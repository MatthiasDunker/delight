## Installation

Delight.js is an enhancement of emotion theming. It does not work as a standalone and [emotion.js](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) is a peer dependency. So emotion has to be installed, too.

```sh
npm i @delight/react
```

## Versioning Scheme

The delight library is currently in **beta**. It is used in production by several websites, but expect that significant changes might be made. Therefore the current versioning scheme maintains the following convention: `0.MAJOR.MINOR`.

With the first `1.x` release we will switch to "Semantic Versioning": `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

## Quick start

```js
import { css, useTheme } from "@delight/react";
```
